# Bulk Download Satellite Imagery
Code used to download and process large amounts of Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery using various methods.

## Using geemap Python package (geemap_download_imagery.ipynb): 
This method has the benefit of removing the need for manually building mosaics, and makes use of analysis ready products (e.g., Landsat-8 surface reflectance) hosted by Google. This method also provides the benefit of skipping the need to download earth engine data to your google drive first, since geemap can download imagery directly to your local drive.
